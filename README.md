# AApileup2.0
AApileup pipeline usable in python rather than needing a bash script.

Working on pipline yet.  No longer requires SAMtools.  
Does require the Python module: pysam.  Also requires Python module: MySQLdb.  
Bowtie2 must be installed and added to $PATH.  
Run variations_tables.sql in MySQL to set up tables first.
